# AUTO-TEMP-FILES-CLEANER

ðŸš€ Boosting PC/Laptop Performance Made Easy! ðŸš€

I'm excited to share my latest project: a one-click script to automatically delete temporary files from your PC or laptop. This project tackles a common yet often-overlooked issue of system performance degradation due to overloaded temp files.

ðŸ”¹ Why It Matters:
Temporary files pile up over time, consuming valuable storage space and slowing down your device's performance. Regularly cleaning these files is crucial, but many users avoid it due to the manual steps involved.

ðŸ”¹ My Solution:
Using Python with the PyAutoGUI and Keyboard libraries, I created a script that:
âœ… Automates the process of locating and deleting temp files.
âœ… Works with just a single clickâ€”run the script, and it does the rest.
âœ… Saves time and ensures that your device runs smoothly!

ðŸ”¹ How It Works:

Identifies and opens the temp and %temp% directories.
Selects and deletes all files within seconds.
Streamlines the entire process, making it effortless and efficient.
This project is my contribution to helping everyone maintain their systems without the hassle of manual cleanup. ðŸ’»
